# BlockChainClient
A simple blockchain client that expose API with limited features for demo purposes 


For this blockchain client to be production ready it needs many more features and additions to ensure reliability, scalability, observability, security and usefulness for user:

 1. API Logging  
- Use structured logging (Winston, Logrus).  
- Store logs in files or cloud (ELK, CloudWatch).  

 2. Health Check (`/health`)  
- Check database, cache, and external services.  
- Use for Kubernetes & load balancers.  

 3. Default Path (`/`) â†’ API Docs  
- Serve Swagger UI, Redoc, or GraphQL Playground.  

 4. Security  
- Auth: Use JWT, OAuth, or API keys.  
- Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse.  
- Secure Headers: Use Helmet.  
- Input Validation: Prevent SQL injection & XSS.  

 5. Monitoring & Metrics (`/metrics`)  
- Use Prometheus + Grafana for API performance.  

 6. Database & Caching  
- Use connection pooling.  
- Add Redis or Memcached for caching.  

 7. Deployment & Scalability  
- Use Docker + Kubernetes + ECS Autoscale.
- Automate deployment with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).  

 8. Graceful Shutdown  
- Handle SIGTERM for clean exits.  

 9. Config Management  
- Use `.env` files, AWS Secrets Manager, or Vault.
- Configure for remote and secured terraform storage

 10. Automated Testing
- Integration Tests (API & DB interactions).  
- Load Testing (k6, JMeter).
